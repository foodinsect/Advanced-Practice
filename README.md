# ðŸ’¾ Verilog Modules

Welcome to the Verilog Modules repository! This repository contains various Verilog modules created as part of the Digital System Design course. The modules are organized into different directories based on their functionality and purpose.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- `00_Simple_Modules`: Contain simple Verilog modules for various purposes.
- `01_fixed_point_operator`: Contains Verilog modules related to fixed-point arithmetic operations.
- `02_Matrix_Multipilier`: Contains Verilog modules for matrix multiplication operations.
- `03_Controller`: Contains Verilog modules for different types of controllers.
- `04_Quantization`: Contains Verilog modules for quantization processes.

## ðŸ“š Digital System Design Practice

Each directory from `01` to `04` includes modules and practices created during the Digital System Design course. Here is a brief overview of what each directory contains:

### 01_fixed_point_operator
Modules for performing fixed-point arithmetic operations, including addition, multiplication.

### 02_Matrix_Multipilier
Modules for matrix multiplication, designed to handle different matrix sizes and configurations.

### 03_Controller
Modules for various types of controllers used in digital systems, such as state machines and control units.
- Recursive vs Streamline

### 04_Quantization
Modules for quantization processes, essential for digital signal processing and reducing the bit-width of data.

## ðŸ”§ Future Plans

- **00_Simple_Modules**: This directory will be populated with simple and additional Verilog modules to enhance learning and practical application.
