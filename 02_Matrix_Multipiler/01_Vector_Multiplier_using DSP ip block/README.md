## Overview

This project contains a Verilog implementation of a Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) unit along with a testbench for simulation. The MAC unit takes two signed 8-bit inputs, multiplies them, accumulates the result, and provides a 32-bit signed output. The testbench is designed to validate the functionality of the MAC unit.

## Conclusion
This README provides an overview of the MAC module and its testbench. The testbench applies a series of inputs to the MAC module to ensure its correct functionality. The project is suitable for FPGA or ASIC design verification purposes. For any issues or improvements, please feel free to contribute or raise an issue.
